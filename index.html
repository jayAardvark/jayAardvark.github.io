      <p id='about-text'>I am a recent graduate of UCSD (2018) where I enjoyed—battled!—my way through what I like to think of as problem-solving training. Countless hours were spent staring at pages uncomprehendingly, non-working brain flickering like a lightbulb about to go out, until at last I found elusive solutions! This “problem-solving training” was presented to me in many different forms—from calculus to grammatically parsing ancient Latin texts to be translated into English to puzzle-like programming challenges in MatLab. And so, perhaps, one way that I can categorize myself is as a (Fairly) Diverse Problem-Solver.<br><br>Another significant category that I think I fall under is as a Music Lover. Not only do I enjoy writing and recording music as a hobby, but music has also led me into an electronics hobby—I enjoy, for example, modifying the electronics in my guitars and building effects pedals and working on vintage vacuum tube amplifiers.<br><br>All of the about-me stuff above has led to the creation of this work-in-progress page along with the apps that I’ve built that are presented here. I have studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a sort of curiosity for a while now but up until recently I haven’t touched any frameworks such as React.  The apps that I’ve built and present here showcase my growing relationship with React as I learn by doing in React.<br><br>Contact me if you could use a "(Fairly) Diverse Problem-Solver" to help you achieve your goals!
